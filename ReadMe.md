- Converting Typescript code to equivalent JS is called "Transpilation".

- "tsc" is the tool used to perfrom the Transpilation.

- npm present in "NodeJS"

let and const.

# string

    - "", '', `(backtick) `

    - backtick operator introduced in ES6.

    - ``backtick operator used to define the paragraphs.

# how to do transpilation?

    > tsc demo.ts

    > node demo.js

    > name is the predefined JavaScript Variable.
